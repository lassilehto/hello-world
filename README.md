# hello-world
This is my first repository - created for testing and familiarising myself with GitHub

I work as research manager at the Finnish Geospatial Research Institute (FGI) in Finland. I am now testing GitHub to see, whether I could somehow use it for my research projects.

I now test this same repository for managing my code developed in the _GIS Python Course_ at CSC.
